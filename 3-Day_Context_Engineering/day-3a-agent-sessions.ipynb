However, my knowledge cutoff is **June 2024**. Therefore, I can only provide you with the latest news and developments up to that point.\n\nTo give you the most relevant information, could you tell me if you're interested in any specific areas of AI in healthcare? For example, are you looking for news on:\n\n*   **Drug discovery and development?**\n*   **Diagnostic imaging and radiology?**\n*   **Personalized medicine and treatment plans?**\n*   **Robotics in surgery?**\n*   **AI for patient monitoring and management?**\n*   **Ethical considerations and regulations in AI healthcare?**\n*   **Specific diseases or conditions?**\n\nIn the meantime, here's a general overview of some of the key trends and developments in AI in healthcare that were prominent leading up to June 2024:\n\n**Key Trends and Developments (up to June 2024):**\n\n*   **Advancements in Diagnostic Capabilities:** AI continued to make significant strides in analyzing medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs) for early detection of diseases like cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular conditions. Algorithms were becoming more sophisticated, often matching or even surpassing human accuracy in specific tasks.\n*   **Accelerated Drug Discovery and Development:** AI platforms were increasingly used to identify potential drug candidates, predict their efficacy and toxicity, and optimize clinical trial design. This promised to shorten the time and reduce the cost of bringing new treatments to market.\n*   **Personalized Treatment and Precision Medicine:** AI was crucial in analyzing vast datasets of patient information (genomics, lifestyle, medical history) to create tailored treatment plans, predict individual responses to therapies, and identify patients at higher risk for certain conditions.\n*   **AI-Powered Virtual Assistants and Chatbots:** These tools were being developed and deployed to assist with patient triage, appointment scheduling, answering common health questions, and providing mental health support, freeing up healthcare professionals for more complex tasks.\n*   **Robotics and Automation:** AI was enhancing robotic surgery with improved precision, minimally invasive techniques, and real-time data analysis during procedures.

Drug discovery was a very active area for AI development leading up to June 2024. Here are some of the key new developments and trends in AI-powered drug discovery:\n\n**Key Developments in AI for Drug Discovery (up to June 2024):**\n\n*   **Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:** This was a significant leap. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and other deep learning models were not just analyzing existing compounds but were actively *designing* entirely new molecules with desired properties. This included designing molecules that could bind to specific protein targets or possess favorable pharmacokinetic profiles (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes a drug).\n*   **AI for Target Identification and Validation:** AI was becoming more adept at sifting through massive biological datasets (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics) to identify novel drug targets – the specific molecules or pathways in the body that a drug should act upon to treat a disease. This included identifying targets for complex diseases where traditional methods struggled.\n*   **Predictive Models for Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models were being refined to predict, with greater accuracy, how effective a potential drug candidate would be and what its potential side effects or toxicities might be *before* extensive and expensive laboratory testing. This helped to de-risk the drug development pipeline.\n*   **Accelerated Synthesis Planning:** AI was assisting chemists by suggesting efficient synthetic routes to create promising drug molecules in the lab, optimizing reaction conditions and minimizing waste.\n*   **AI in Clinical Trial Optimization:** While not strictly discovery, AI was being used to improve the efficiency of clinical trials, which are the next crucial step after discovery. This included identifying optimal patient populations for trials, predicting patient response to trial drugs, and even helping to design more effective trial protocols.\n*   **Repurposing Existing Drugs:** AI algorithms were continuously scanning databases of approved drugs to identify those that could be effective against new diseases or conditions. This is a faster and less expensive route to new treatments as safety profiles are already established.\n*   **\"Digital Twins\" for Drug Development:** The concept of creating \"digital twins\" of biological systems or even individual patients was gaining traction. These AI-powered simulations could be used to test drug candidates in a virtual environment, predict outcomes, and personalize drug development.\n*   **Focus on Undruggable Targets:** AI was showing promise in tackling previously \"undruggable\" targets – proteins or biological pathways that are difficult to target with conventional small molecules or antibodies. This opened up new avenues for treating diseases that have lacked effective therapies.\n*   **Increased Partnerships and Investments:** There was a surge in collaborations between AI companies and traditional pharmaceutical giants, as well as significant venture capital investment in AI-driven drug discovery startups. This indicated a strong belief in the transformative potential of AI in this field.\n\n**Examples of Areas Seeing AI Impact:**\n\n*   **Oncology:** Identifying new cancer targets, designing personalized cancer therapies, and predicting treatment response.\n*   **Neurodegenerative Diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's):** Uncovering novel therapeutic strategies for complex neurological conditions.\n*   **Infectious Diseases:** Rapidly designing antivirals and antibiotics, especially in response to emerging threats.\n\nThe key takeaway is that AI is moving beyond simply analyzing data to actively *generating* new knowledge and solutions in drug discovery, significantly speeding up and de-risking the entire process.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the **\"AI for Target Identification and Validation\"** development. This is a crucial area because finding the right target is the very first step in developing a new drug. If you don't hit the right biological \"switch,\" even the most sophisticated drug molecule won't work.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what AI is doing in this space:\n\n**AI for Target Identification and Validation: Breaking it Down**\n\nTraditionally, identifying drug targets has been a painstaking, iterative process. Researchers would study a disease, hypothesize about what goes wrong at a molecular level, and then conduct countless experiments to prove or disprove their hypothesis. AI is revolutionizing this by:\n\n1.  **Analyzing Massive, Multi-Omic Datasets:**\n    *   **What are \"Omics\"?** This refers to various large-scale biological data types:\n        *   **Genomics:** The study of an organism's complete set of DNA. AI can analyze genetic variations associated with diseases.\n        *   **Proteomics:** The study of the complete set of proteins in an organism. AI can identify proteins that are over- or under-expressed in diseased cells.\n        *   **Transcriptomics:** The study of RNA molecules produced by genes. AI can help understand which genes are being actively transcribed and translated into proteins.\n        *   **Metabolomics:** The study of small molecules (metabolites) in an organism. AI can link metabolic changes to disease states.\n    *   **How AI Helps:** AI algorithms, particularly machine learning and deep learning, are exceptionally good at finding patterns and correlations in these vast and complex datasets that human researchers might miss. They can integrate data from multiple \"omics\" sources to build a more holistic picture of disease mechanisms.\n\n2.  **Identifying Novel Pathways and Mechanisms:**\n    *   **Beyond the Obvious:** AI can uncover subtle connections between genes, proteins, and disease states that weren't previously understood. For example, it might identify a network of proteins that, when disrupted, contribute to a disease, rather than focusing on a single protein in isolation.\n    *   **Understanding Disease Heterogeneity:** Many diseases, like cancer or Alzheimer's, are not monolithic. AI can help identify distinct subtypes of a disease, each with potentially different underlying molecular mechanisms, suggesting the need for different drug targets for different patient groups.\n\n3.  **Prioritizing Potential Targets:**\n    *   **Data-Driven Prioritization:** Not every identified anomaly is a good drug target. AI models can be trained to predict the \"druggability\" of a potential target – its likelihood of being successfully modulated by a drug to achieve a therapeutic effect.\n    *   **Predicting Causality vs. Correlation:** AI can help researchers distinguish between biological changes that *cause* a disease and those that are merely *correlated* with it. A causative factor is a much better target for a drug.\n\n4.  **Leveraging Existing Literature and Databases:**\n    *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** AI uses NLP to read and understand scientific papers, patents, and clinical trial data at an unprecedented scale. This allows it to identify emerging trends, connections between research areas, and potential targets that might have been overlooked.\n\n**Validation Aspects:**\n\nOnce a potential target is identified, it needs to be validated. AI contributes here too by:\n\n*   **Predicting the Impact of Target Modulation:** AI can simulate what would happen if a specific target were inhibited or activated, helping researchers anticipate the downstream effects on other biological processes.\n*   **Guiding Experimental Design:** Based on AI predictions, researchers can design more focused and efficient experiments to validate the identified target.\n\n**Why is this so important?**\n\n*   **Reduces R&D Costs:** Identifying the wrong target early on can waste billions of dollars and years of research. AI helps focus resources on more promising leads.\n*   **Speeds up the Process:** AI can sift through data and generate hypotheses much faster than human researchers alone.\n*   **Unlocks New Therapeutic Avenues:** AI's ability to see complex patterns can lead to the identification of targets for diseases that have been intractable with traditional methods.\n\nIn essence, AI is transforming drug target identification from a somewhat serendipitous and labor-intensive process into a more systematic, data-driven, and predictive endeavor.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the key players in the AI-driven drug discovery space, specifically focusing on target identification and validation. This is a rapidly evolving field with a mix of established pharmaceutical giants and innovative biotech startups.\n\nIt's important to note that \"main companies\" can be categorized in a few ways:\n\n*   **AI-Native Drug Discovery Companies:** These companies were built from the ground up with AI at their core.

They focus on creating vast datasets of cellular images and applying machine learning to discover new insights into diseases.\n*   **Atomwise:** While perhaps more known for molecule design, Atomwise's AI platform can also contribute to target identification by predicting how potential drugs will interact with targets.\n*   **Insitro:** Founded by Daphne Koller, Insitro aims to build a machine learning-driven drug discovery and development organization. They focus on generating large-scale datasets and applying ML to understand disease biology and identify targets.\n*   **Schrodinger:** While also a long-standing player in computational chemistry, Schrodinger has significantly integrated AI and machine learning into its platform, which helps in target identification and validation by predicting molecular interactions and properties.\n*   **Cerebras Systems:** While not directly a drug discovery company, Cerebras builds specialized AI hardware (like their Wafer Scale Engine) that is crucial for processing the massive datasets required for advanced AI drug discovery, including target ID. Many drug discovery companies leverage their technology.\n\n**Major Pharmaceutical Companies with Significant AI Initiatives:**\n\n*   **Pfizer:** Has been actively investing in AI for drug discovery, including target identification, and has formed partnerships with AI companies.\n*   **Novartis:** Similar to Pfizer, Novartis has a dedicated focus on AI and machine learning across its R&D pipeline, including early-stage discovery and target validation.\n*   **AstraZeneca:** Has been a pioneer in using AI for drug discovery, with initiatives aimed at identifying novel targets and accelerating the entire development process.\n*   **Roche (Genentech):** Known for its strong R&D capabilities, Roche has also been integrating AI to enhance its target identification and validation efforts.\n*   **Sanofi:** Sanofi has been expanding its AI capabilities, including partnerships and internal development, to improve its drug discovery processes.\n*   **Merck & Co.:** Actively exploring and implementing AI solutions in its research, including target discovery.\n*   **Gilead Sciences:** Increasingly leveraging AI and machine learning to accelerate its research and development.\n\n**AI Platform and Tool Providers (that enable target ID):**\n\n*   **NVIDIA:** Their GPUs and AI software platforms (like Clara Discovery) are foundational for many AI drug discovery efforts, enabling the computational power needed for analyzing large datasets and training complex models for target identification.\n*   **Google Cloud / DeepMind:** While DeepMind is known for AlphaFold (protein folding, which is related to target understanding), Google Cloud provides the essential AI infrastructure and services used by many companies.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Partnerships are Key:** The landscape is characterized by numerous collaborations. AI startups often partner with large pharma companies, bringing their AI expertise to the established pipelines and resources of the larger organizations.\n*   **Data is Paramount:** The success of AI in target identification hinges on access to high-quality, diverse biological data. Companies that excel in data generation and integration often have a competitive edge.\n*   **Rapid Evolution:** This list is a snapshot, and the field is constantly evolving with new companies emerging and existing ones expanding their capabilities.\n\nWhen researching, look for companies that explicitly mention using AI for **\"target identification,\" \"target validation,\" \"disease mechanism understanding,\"** or **\"biomarker discovery\"** as part of their core mission.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.3 Verifying Compaction in the Session History\n\nThe conversation above looks normal, but the history has been changed behind the scenes.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
